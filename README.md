#Baconian Cipher
##Overview
The Baconian cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter of the plaintext is replaced by a group of five characters, typically 'A' and 'B'. It is named after Sir Francis Bacon, who popularized its use in the late 16th century.

In the Baconian cipher, each letter of the alphabet is assigned a unique combination of 5 letters of  'A's and 'B's. For example:

The letter 'A' might be represented as 'AAAAA'.
The letter 'B' might be represented as 'AAAAB'.
The letter 'C' might be represented as 'AAABA'.
